# Task Management System Backend Documentation

## Overview

The Task Management System backend is a Flask API application designed to manage projects, tasks, and users through a RESTful interface. It utilizes PostgreSQL for data storage and authentication via JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

## Features

- **Projects Management:**
  - Create, retrieve, update, and delete projects.
- **Tasks Management:**
  - Add tasks to projects, retrieve all tasks or tasks by project ID, update task details, and delete tasks.
- **User Management:**
  - Register new users, authenticate via login to obtain JWT tokens, refresh tokens, retrieve user information, update user details, and delete users.
- **Authorization:**
  - JWT tokens provide access and admin authorization checks.
- **Health Check and Access Validation:**
  - Endpoint to check API server status and validate JWT token access.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your local machine.
- Docker Compose installed.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and define the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   FLASK_ENV=development
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/taskdb
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

   Replace `password` with your PostgreSQL password.

3. **Build and Run the Backend**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the API**

   The backend API is accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Deployment on AWS ECS

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with necessary permissions.
- AWS CLI configured locally.
- Docker Hub account (or other Docker registry).

### Steps

1. **Containerize the Backend**

   - Ensure the `Dockerfile` in the `backend` directory is configured to use Gunicorn and expose port `5000`.

2. **Push Docker Image to Registry**

   - Build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub (or another registry):

     ```bash
     docker build -t <docker-username>/task-management-backend .
     docker push <docker-username>/task-management-backend
     ```

3. **Configure ECS Task Definition**

   - Create an ECS task definition that references your Docker image and defines environment variables.

4. **Create ECS Cluster**

   - Create an ECS cluster in your desired AWS region.

5. **Deploy Service on ECS**

   - Create an ECS service using your task definition, configure load balancing if necessary.

6. **Access the Deployed API**

   - Once deployed, the backend API will be accessible via the ECS service endpoint.

## Conclusion

The Task Management System backend provides a robust API for managing projects, tasks, and users securely. By following these setup instructions, you can deploy and manage the backend both locally and on AWS ECS, ensuring scalability and reliability for your application.
